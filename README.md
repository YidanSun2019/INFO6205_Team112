## Introduction

In computer science and operations research, a genetic al- gorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolu- tionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. The goal of the project is to look into a Paramecium(graphic) Genetic prob- lem analogy and find the best solution to the problem.


## Background

In this project, we need to generate our starting patterns via genetic algorithms randomly. Applying Genetic Algorithm to find the best genotype. We should select the best genotype from the original population at first. Then applying mutation operation and the same fitness to find the best  mutation  genotype. 
During the process, we need to set the number of evaluate generation sand maximum number of  generations first. Then, we should calculate the fitness of each individual in initial graph groups. After selection, crossover, mutation and increase diversity operations, the best generation of groups is obtained. We also need to set termination conditions for judgment. Before that, we will output the graph with maximum fitness obtained during the evolution as the optimal solution.
